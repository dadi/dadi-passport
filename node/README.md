## Overview

DADI Passport is a library for generating access tokens to authenticate with DADI platform components.

Various components within the DADI stack implement 2-legged oAuth2, requiring a bearer token to authorise requests. This bearer token is obtained as a response sent to a specific endpoint with a clientId/secret pair, along with a TTL defined by the provider.

This library can be used by third-party applications that wish to integrate with DADI, as it abstracts the oAuth protocol by storing and requesting bearer tokens as needed, and returning always a promise with a valid bearer token.

## Node.js

The Node.js implementation returns a Promise, either resolving with a valid bearer token to access the issuer or failing with a [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org/format/#errors) compliant error object.

By using the request injection option, it is also possible to receive a request function with the authorisation headers injected, abstracting all the authentication logic and making a call to a DADI component extremely straightforward.

Please see the `docs` branch for [usage examples](https://github.com/dadi/passport/blob/docs/docs/node/usageExamples.md).
